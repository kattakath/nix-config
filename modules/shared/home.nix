# Unified user profile — loaded on EVERY machine (macOS, Pi, sandbox VM).
# The single home of "user logic"; system-level platform specifics live in
# modules/darwin and modules/nixos.
#
# Personal token VALUES are intentionally NOT managed here. On macOS they live
# in the login Keychain (encrypted at rest) — stored/registered by `secret set`
# and exported into EVERY shell (not just login ones) by the darwin-only loader
# from the keychain-secrets flake (programs.keychainSecrets), which loads once per
# process tree and lets descendants inherit. Nothing plaintext is written to disk.
# The Keychain is macOS-only, so the Linux hosts get no personal-token mechanism
# here (use one-time CLI logins: gh/hf/docker/claude).
#
# SYSTEM/SERVICE secrets are separate from this profile: committed encrypted via
# agenix (secrets/*.age → /run/agenix/<name> at activation, e.g. the macos
# runner PAT). The exception is nixpi's Cloudflare tunnel token, planted on the
# FAT FIRMWARE partition → /run/cloudflared-token (agenix would bind it to the SSH
# host key a fresh SD flash rotates — see hosts/nixpi.nix).
#
# Deliberately MINIMAL: no nixvim/tmux — the operator uses VSCode/Cursor and
# prefers a lean profile with starship for the shell prompt. Add tools only for
# a clear cross-host need.

  # The AVD name selects the system image: a name containing "play" — the DEFAULT
  # `pixel_play`, launched by a bare `android-emu` — gets the Google Play image (has

  # running, so a plain `defaults write` gets clobbered. The reliable path is to
  # let the running Terminal import the profile itself via `open`, which persists.
  # Guarded on absence so it runs ONCE (first activation on a fresh Mac) — later
  # rebuilds are a no-op and never pop a window. Setting it as the default is
  # best-effort (again, Terminal may overwrite while running): if it doesn't
