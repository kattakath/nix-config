# /brag — Developer Accomplishment Report

Generate a work accomplishment report by aggregating data from multiple sources and presenting it with impact framing.

## Injected Context

- Current date: !`date +%Y-%m-%d`
- Git author: !`git config user.name 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"`
- GitHub user: !`gh api user --jq .login 2>/dev/null || echo "not authenticated"`
- Repo URL: !`gh repo view --json url -q .url 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"`

## Step 0: Help / No Arguments

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, or is `help`, `--help`, or `?`, display this usage guide and stop — do NOT generate a report:

```
/brag — Developer Accomplishment Report

Usage: /brag <time range> [--log | --announce] [--short] [--slack #channel]
       /brag setup          Configure data sources and preferences

Time ranges:
  today              Today's activity (default if omitted with a mode flag)
  yesterday          Yesterday's activity
  week               Monday of this week to today
  last_week          Last Monday through last Sunday
  7d, 14d            Last N days
  2026-02-01..02-14  Custom date range
  "last two weeks"   Natural language also works

Output modes:
  (default)          Narrative — grouped by impact themes (Shipped, Kept the Lights On, etc.)
  --log              Technical changelog — organized by data source (PRs, commits, tasks)
  --announce         Product announcement — product-updates format for stakeholders

Length:
  (default)          Detailed report
  --short            Condensed version (~15-25 lines)

Slack:
  --slack #channel   Post report to a Slack channel
  --slack @user      Send as DM (use "for myself" to DM yourself)

Setup:
  /brag setup                            Configure data sources and preferences

Impact & Value:
  /brag impact                         View your long-term impact document
  /brag impact add                     Add an entry to your impact document
  /brag value                          View your developer value document
  /brag value add                      Add a domain to your developer value doc

Examples:
  /brag last_week                        Narrative report for last week
  /brag 14d --short                      Quick summary of last 2 weeks
  /brag last_week --log                  Technical changelog
  /brag last_week --announce             Product update draft
  /brag week --short --slack #standup    Short report posted to Slack
  /brag impact                         View long-term impact document
  /brag impact add                     Add a new impact entry
  /brag value                          View developer value document
  /brag value add                      Add a new domain

Data sources: GitHub PRs, git commits, Asana tasks, Claude Code sessions,
              Slack activity, Sentry issues, PR review depth
```

## Step 0.5: Setup Flow (`/brag setup`)

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `setup`, run this interactive configuration flow instead of generating a report.

### Phase 1: Auto-Detect Sources (run ALL checks in parallel)

1. **GitHub**: `gh auth status`
2. **Git**: use the injected Git author above
3. **Asana MCP**: ToolSearch for "asana" — if available, use `mcp__asana__asana_list_workspaces`
4. **Slack MCP**: ToolSearch for "slack" — look for logged-in user's ID in tool descriptions
5. **Sentry MCP**: ToolSearch for "sentry" — if available, use `mcp__sentry__find_organizations` and `mcp__sentry__find_projects`
6. **Claude Sessions**: check if `~/.claude/history.jsonl` exists

### Phase 2: Display Status and Ask Questions

Display a status table:

```
/brag setup — Source Configuration

| Source           | Status      | Details                    |
|------------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| GitHub           | ✓ Ready     | Authenticated as @username |
| Git              | ✓ Ready     | Author: "Your Name"        |
| Asana            | ✓ Available | Workspace: "Company"       |
| Slack            | ✓ Available | User: U12345               |
| Sentry           | ✓ Available | Org: org-slug              |
| Claude Sessions  | ✓ Ready     | history.jsonl found        |
```

Use `✓ Ready` for sources that work out of the box, `✓ Available` for detected MCP sources, `✗ Not found` for unavailable sources.

Then ask source-specific questions using AskUserQuestion:
1. **Slack channels** (if available): "Which Slack channel do you use for product updates?"
2. **Sentry project** (if multiple): "Which Sentry project should /brag monitor?"
3. **Default preferences**: mode (Narrative/Log/Announce) and time range (last_week/week/7d/14d)

### Phase 3: Write Config

Write `config.json` into the brag data directory — `BRAG_DATA_DIR` (default `$HOME/Developer/local/brags`, the writable private brags repo; NOT this read-only Nix-managed skill dir). See [config.json.example](config.json.example) for the schema.

Set `"enabled": false` for undetected sources. After writing, display a summary and stop — do NOT proceed to generate a report.

## Step 0.6: Impact Document (`/brag impact` and `/brag impact add`)

If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `impact`, handle it here and stop — do NOT continue to report generation.

### Determine Skill Directory

```bash
# Data lives in the writable private brags repo, NOT this (read-only, Nix-managed) skill dir.
BRAG_DATA_DIR="${BRAG_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/Developer/local/brags}"
mkdir -p "$BRAG_DATA_DIR"
IMPACT_PATH="$BRAG_DATA_DIR/impact.md"
```

### `/brag impact` — View Impact Document

If `$ARGUMENTS` is exactly `impact`:

1. Read `$IMPACT_PATH` using the Read tool
2. If the file exists, display its contents rendered as Markdown
3. If the file does not exist, display:

```
No impact document yet.

Run /brag impact add to create your first entry, or generate a narrative report
and you'll be prompted to save significant deliverables automatically.
```

**Then stop.**

### `/brag impact add` — Add Impact Entry

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `impact add`:

1. Read `$IMPACT_PATH` if it exists (to append to it). If it doesn't exist, prepare to create it with the initial frontmatter:

```markdown
---
version: 1
last_updated: {TODAY}
---
```

2. Ask the user for each field using AskUserQuestion, one at a time:

   **Question 1 — Title:**
   "What's the name of the feature or project?" (open-ended)

   **Question 2 — When:**
   "When did you work on this?" with options:
   - "This month" → `{current YYYY-MM}`
   - "Last month" → `{previous YYYY-MM}`
   - "A date range" → prompt for `YYYY-MM — YYYY-MM` or similar

   **Question 3 — Metrics:**
   "Any quantifiable impact? (e.g. 'Reduced latency by 40%', '200+ daily workflows affected')"
   with options:
   - "I have metrics" → prompt for the metrics text
   - "Skip for now" → leave Metrics line empty

   **Question 4 — Links:**
   "Any links to PRs, tasks, or docs?" with options:
   - "I have links" → prompt for the links (Markdown format)
   - "Skip for now" → leave Links line empty

   **Question 5 — Description:**
   "Describe the impact in 1-3 sentences. Focus on what changed for users or the team, not what code was written." (open-ended)

3. Append the new entry to `$IMPACT_PATH`:

```markdown

---

## {Title}

**When:** {When}
**Metrics:** {Metrics}
**Links:** {Links}

{Description}
```

4. Update the `last_updated` field in the YAML frontmatter to today's date.

5. Display the new entry and confirm: "Added to your impact document."

**Then stop.**

### Auto-Add from Report (used by Step 4)

When called programmatically from Step 4's auto-suggest flow (not directly by the user), the same append logic is used but with pre-filled values from the report deliverable. The user confirms or edits each field before saving.

## Step 0.7: Developer Value (`/brag value` and `/brag value add`)

If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `value`, handle it here and stop — do NOT continue to report generation.

### Determine Skill Directory

```bash
# Data lives in the writable private brags repo, NOT this (read-only, Nix-managed) skill dir.
BRAG_DATA_DIR="${BRAG_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/Developer/local/brags}"
mkdir -p "$BRAG_DATA_DIR"
VALUE_PATH="$BRAG_DATA_DIR/developer-value.md"
```

### `/brag value` — View Developer Value Document

If `$ARGUMENTS` is exactly `value`:

1. Read `$VALUE_PATH` using the Read tool
2. If the file exists, display its contents rendered as Markdown
3. If the file does not exist, display:

```
No developer value document yet.

Run /brag value add to define your first domain of expertise.
```

**Then stop.**

### `/brag value add` — Add Domain

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `value add`:

1. Read `$VALUE_PATH` if it exists (to append to it). If it doesn't exist, prepare to create it with the initial frontmatter:

```markdown
---
version: 1
last_updated: {TODAY}
---
```

2. Ask the user for each field using AskUserQuestion:

   **Question 1 — Domain name:**
   "What domain or area of expertise do you want to add?" (open-ended, e.g. "Data Ingestion", "Authentication", "Developer Experience")

   **Question 2 — Summary:**
   "Describe your role and expertise in this domain in 1-3 sentences." (open-ended)

3. Append the new entry to `$VALUE_PATH`:

```markdown

## {Domain Name}

{Summary}
```

4. Update the `last_updated` field in the YAML frontmatter to today's date.

5. Display the new entry and confirm: "Added to your developer value document."

**Then stop.**

## Step 1: Parse Arguments and Compute Date Range

### Load Config (if exists)

Check for `config.json` in the brag data directory — `BRAG_DATA_DIR` (default `$HOME/Developer/local/brags`). If it exists:
- Use `defaults.time_range` when no time range in `$ARGUMENTS`
- Use `defaults.mode` when no mode flag in `$ARGUMENTS`
- Use `defaults.short` when no `--short` flag in `$ARGUMENTS`

**Important**: If config provides defaults, do NOT show help text when `$ARGUMENTS` is empty — use the defaults and generate a report. Help is only for explicit `help`, `--help`, or `?`.

### Parse Flags

Extract flags from `$ARGUMENTS` (remove each after extracting):
- `--slack #channel-name` or `--slack @user` → Slack target
- `--log` → LOG mode | `--announce` → ANNOUNCE mode | no flag → NARRATIVE mode
- `--short` → SHORT length
- Natural language: "short"/"brief" → SHORT; "changelog"/"technical" → LOG; "announce"/"product update" → ANNOUNCE

### Compute Date Range

For date arithmetic details, see [reference/date-parsing.md](reference/date-parsing.md).

Compute START_DATE and END_DATE as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings using macOS `date -v`.

## Step 2: Collect Data (All Sources in Parallel)

Use parallel tool calls for all sources simultaneously. Each source is independent — if one fails, continue with the others.

For detailed collection instructions per source, see [reference/data-sources.md](reference/data-sources.md).

**Sources to collect (all in parallel):**

1. **GitHub PRs** — authored and reviewed PRs via `gh pr list` (use injected Repo URL for commit links)
2. **PR Review Depth** — classify review quality (NARRATIVE and LOG modes only)
3. **Git Commits** — `git log` using injected Git author
4. **Claude Code Sessions** — read `~/.claude/history.jsonl`, deduplicate by sessionId
5. **Asana Tasks** (MCP, optional) — completed tasks in date range
6. **Slack Activity** (MCP, optional) — filter by signal level per mode
7. **Sentry Issues** (MCP, optional) — resolved issues with impact numbers

### Config-Aware Optimization

If config exists: skip disabled sources, use stored values (author name, Slack user ID, workspace GID, org/project slugs), skip ToolSearch for known MCP sources.

## Step 3: Auto-Clustering (NARRATIVE and ANNOUNCE modes only)

Skip this step for LOG mode. For detailed clustering rules, see [reference/clustering.md](reference/clustering.md).

Cluster related items into deliverables, then categorize each into one of four themes:
- **Shipped**: features that went to production
- **Kept the Lights On**: on-call, hotfixes, Sentry issues, incidents
- **Invested in the Future**: tooling, refactors, DX, docs
- **Helped the Team**: reviews, unblocking, knowledge sharing

## Step 4: Generate Report

Use the appropriate template based on mode and length:
- **NARRATIVE** (default): see [templates/narrative.md](templates/narrative.md)
- **LOG** (`--log`): see [templates/log.md](templates/log.md)
- **ANNOUNCE** (`--announce`): see [templates/announce.md](templates/announce.md)

### Post-Report: Auto-Suggest Impact & Value Updates

After generating a NARRATIVE or NARRATIVE SHORT report (not LOG or ANNOUNCE), check if any deliverables should be saved to the impact or developer value documents.

**Skip this entire section if the report mode is LOG or ANNOUNCE.**

#### Impact Suggestions

1. Determine the skill directory:

```bash
# Data lives in the writable private brags repo, NOT this (read-only, Nix-managed) skill dir.
BRAG_DATA_DIR="${BRAG_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/Developer/local/brags}"
mkdir -p "$BRAG_DATA_DIR"
IMPACT_PATH="$BRAG_DATA_DIR/impact.md"
VALUE_PATH="$BRAG_DATA_DIR/developer-value.md"
```

2. Review the deliverables from the "Shipped" and "Invested in the Future" sections of the generated report.

3. A deliverable is considered **significant** if it meets ANY of these criteria:
   - 3 or more merged PRs in the cluster
   - 5 or more commits in the cluster
   - Has an associated Sentry issue with 50+ users affected
   - Spans work across 3+ days

4. For each significant deliverable, read `$IMPACT_PATH` (if it exists) and check if a similar entry already exists (matching title keywords). If it already exists, skip it.

5. If there are new significant deliverables, use AskUserQuestion to ask:

   "These deliverables look significant enough for your impact document. Which would you like to save?" with multiSelect options listing each deliverable title. Include a "None" option.

6. For each selected deliverable, pre-fill values from the report data:
   - **Title**: cluster/deliverable title from Step 3
   - **When**: START_DATE — END_DATE from the report
   - **Metrics**: PR additions/deletions totals, Sentry user impact if available
   - **Links**: all PR, Asana, and Sentry links from the cluster
   - **Description**: the impact statement from Step 3 clustering

7. Show the pre-filled entry and ask: "Does this look right, or would you like to edit it?" with options:
   - "Looks good, save it"
   - "Let me edit it" → re-prompt for each field
   - "Skip this one"

8. Append confirmed entries to `$IMPACT_PATH` following the format from Step 0.6. Update `last_updated`.

#### Developer Value Suggestions

1. Read `$VALUE_PATH` (if it exists) and extract the list of domain names (H2 headings).

2. Look at the deliverables from the report. For each one, infer the domain area from:
   - Asana project name
   - PR title keywords
   - File paths changed (if available from commit data)

3. If a deliverable's domain does not match any existing domain in `$VALUE_PATH`, and the deliverable is significant (same criteria as above), ask:

   "Your work on '{deliverable title}' seems to be in a new area. Would you like to add it to your developer value document?" with options:
   - "Yes, add it" → prompt for domain name and summary (pre-fill domain from inferred area)
   - "No, skip"

4. Append confirmed domains to `$VALUE_PATH` following the format from Step 0.7. Update `last_updated`.

## Step 5: Slack Posting (Optional)

Only if `--slack` flag is present or user explicitly asks:

1. Use ToolSearch for "slack send"
2. Use `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_send_message` to post
3. **Format for Slack** (Slack markdown, not GitHub markdown):
   - `*bold*` not `**bold**`
   - Bullet points with `•`
   - Plain URLs (Slack auto-unfurls GitHub and Asana links)
   - For `--announce`, use the emoji-header format from the template
4. For `--announce` with `--slack`, show draft first and ask for confirmation
5. If Slack MCP unavailable, show report in terminal only

## Report Guidelines (All Modes)

- **Always include links** — PRs, Asana tasks, Sentry issues, commits. Non-negotiable.
  - PRs: `[#32517](url)` | Asana: `[Task name](permalink_url)` | Commits: `[hash](repo_url/commit/full_hash)` | Sentry: `[Issue title](url)`
- **Omit empty sections** — never show a section header with zero items
- **Single day reports** use "Work Report: {DATE}" instead of a range
- **Impact framing** (NARRATIVE/ANNOUNCE): describe *what changed for users/the team*, not what files were modified
- **On-call collapsing**: never list identical tasks individually — collapse with count and one example link

## Error Handling

- Each data source is independent — if one fails, continue with the others
- If ALL sources return empty: "No activity found for {date range}. Check that you're in the right git repo and `gh` is authenticated."
- Never show raw error output — fail silently per source
- If `gh` auth fails, suggest `gh auth login`
- For `--announce` with no features: "No features to announce for this period. Try `--log` or default mode to see all activity."
